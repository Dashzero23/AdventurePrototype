A simple adventure game by Nguyen Vu based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: firstRoom, Outside, Hall, Kitchen, Living Room.
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro, Good, Neutral, Bad, Outro (I forgot to delete it).
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: Added in more items for the inventory.
    - Enhancement 2: Change the inventory color.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: firstRoom, Outside, Hall, Kitchen
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Phone, Knife, Flashlight

- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Multiple doors
